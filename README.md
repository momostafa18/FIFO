# FIFO
First in First out buffer used to save the data it has 2 pointers one to track the written data and the other to track the read data, it's a standard FIFO where it write and read data at the clock edge 
The FIFO (First-In-First-Out) project is a hardware design implementation of a FIFO data structure. It provides a mechanism for storing and retrieving data in the order in which it was received, following the First-In-First-Out principle.

This project aims to demonstrate the functionality and implementation of a FIFO using hardware description language (HDL) and a hardware simulation tool.

## Usage
1. Open the simulation tool and load the project files.
2. Simulate the provided testbench or create your own test scenarios.
3. Observe the behavior of the FIFO by analyzing the simulation results.
4. Modify the design files to experiment with different configurations or features.
